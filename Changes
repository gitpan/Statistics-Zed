Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::Zed.

0.07x - cope with dist probs

0.06 2013 Oct
    - lack of a variance value does not throw a croak but returns zero.
    - removed ztest method - send stdev divided by sqrt(N) to zscore instead;
	- series_test() returns same values and accepts same args as basic test,
	- $z_value = $zed->p2z($p) - don't have to use named args here, as already in 'z2p'
	- can send just a single value to series_update(), unkeyed, too
	- no argument "error" recognized - use "variance" or "stdev"

0.05 2010 Sept
	- clean-up error messages to prevent "undef" error

0.04 2010
    - p2z sub
    - distribution issues

0.03x 2010 Sept
	- solving distribution issues
	- removed statistics conversion methods: z2r, r2z, chi2z, z2chi

0.02x 2009 March-May 
	- uses Math::Cephes instead of Statistics::Distributions of z2p
	- p2z function, using Math::Cephes (hence the above change)
	- z2chi algorithm with df
	- aliases for functions, removing underscores
	- s_precision and p_precision attributes are now precision_s and precision_p to conform with other modules
